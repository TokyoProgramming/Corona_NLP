## About the project

This is the project which will create DAG(Directed Acyclic graph) automatically by using path analysis and hill climbing algorhimn<br/>
As you know, these days Bayesian network became pretty common way to create DAG, such as using bnlearn library, however this method will give u back multiple models.
The more data is larger, the more dag will be powerful tool to visualize data causality.

- **what is dag** <br/>
  DAG is part of the graph theory and is a directed graph with no directed cycles. 
  dag sample is down below.<br />
